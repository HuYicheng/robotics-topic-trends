"""Final measure since 2026-10-28 (user: "你不能按词语的搜索来归类吧。你不得通过语义理解来做吗？"): semantic topic labels.

A paper counts for a topic when its own work (method, system, task, platform, data or evaluation) involves the topic, as
read from its title and abstract against data/semantic_codebook_v2.md (labels: data/semantic_labels.csv, collected by
scripts/12a_collect_semantic_labels.py). A topic named only as background, motivation, contrast, related or future work
does not count. The 8 "[term]" columns stay word counts and are copied from the keyword matrix
(data/topic_matrix_ta_keyword.csv, scripts/12_title_abstract.py), which also fixes the papers and their order.
A paper of the keyword matrix without semantic labels stops the script: new papers must be labelled first.

Output: data/topic_matrix_ta.csv       ("involves"; the final measure, same layout as the keyword matrix)
        data/topic_matrix_ta_main.csv  ("main": the 1-3 topics of the main contribution; described only)
